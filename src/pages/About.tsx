                      Our vegan-milk taste testing journey began, ironically
                      enough, with cow milk and a silly joke between colleagues:
                      Soy milk? You mean you mix soy sauce with milk? Sounds
                      terrible. After that rather horrible incident (we cannot
                      recommend you try this at home), we wanted to test actual
                      cow-milk alternatives and, because one of these people is
                      a data scientist, we had to record it.

                  After having recorded and rated more than 100
                  milk-alternatives, and showed our sheet to many friends, we
                  knew what we had to do: make it public. Our data scientist got
                  to work and created a website, available to all, and published
                  all of our results so far and ready to receive more from the
                  original founders but of course everyone else who is keen to
                  test.
