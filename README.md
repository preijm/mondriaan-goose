## What is MilkMeNot?

MilkMeNot is a community-driven platform for discovering and rating plant-based milk alternatives. We're building a comprehensive database of dairy-free milks tested by real people, helping you find the perfect plant milk for your coffee, cereal, or cooking needs.

## The Goal

Together, we're mapping the world of plant-based milk alternatives. With hundreds of products across dozens of brands and countless flavor variations, finding the right plant milk can be overwhelming. MilkMeNot makes it easy by crowdsourcing taste tests and ratings from our community.

## How It Works

1. **Discover** – Browse our database of plant milks, filtered by base (oat, soy, almond, etc.), brand, flavor, and properties (barista, organic, sugar-free).

2. **Test** – Try a plant milk and log your experience. Rate it, add notes about taste and texture, and share whether it works for your preferred drink.

3. **Share** – Your tests contribute to aggregate ratings, helping others discover the best plant milks for their needs.

4. **Explore** – See what the community is testing through our feed, discover trending products, and find hidden gems from around the world.
